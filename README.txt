Hello TA/Professor!
I thought it would be smart to provide how to run my code for each step.

(Before starting I usually run "module load gcc" though that probably doesn't matter)

Step 1 Instructions:
Run "make" in the terminal once in the folder.
A line will print out letting you know once everything has been compiled.
Run "./parser sourcefile" in order to parse each test case (sourcefile being 0StartExit, 1PushI, 2PrintTOS, etc.).
Everytime you run a test case, if it's a valid test case a .out file should be produced.
I have provided the textfiles for the updated testcases_v2 (I used textfiles for each testcase when creating my code).

Step 2 Instructions:
Run "make" in the terminal once in the folder.
A line will print out letting you know once everything is compiled.
Run "./vm sourcefile.out" in order to execute the vm on each test case (sourcefile being 0StartExit.out, 1PsuhI.out, 2PrintTOS.out, etc.).
Simply use the .out files that Step 1 produces on my Step 2.

Thank you!
